## Introduction

Ever wondered how your favorite websites come to life? It all starts with code. My childhood bedroom was a (concealed) graveyard of disassembled electronics: clocks, radios, anything with a circuit board. I had an insatiable curiosity about how things worked, even if putting them back together wasn't always successful. This technical inclination naturally extended to the digital world. Mavis Beacon taught me to type, but the wild world of the internet, accessed via the thrilling screech of dial-up, became my real teacher. While customizing my MySpace profile with elaborate HTML codes felt like magic, it was building a simple website with Microsoft FrontPage that sparked my interest in web development. Though those are both relics of the past, the thrill of creation stuck with me for much longer than I realized. It wasn't until later in life, however, that I seriously considered web development as a career path.

## My Coding Journey

When I decided to become serious about learning to code, I knew I'd be most interested in front end. I did some research and figured out that I should learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript and build upon that. HTML and CSS were old favorites from my MySpace days.

I started learning by teaching myself using resources that are still popular today, including FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy, among others. After spending some time teaching myself, I decided that my path needed more structure, oversight, and direction. I decided to start looking for bootcamps. This was a daunting task considering the high price tag attached to most bootcamps. I had the added bonus of trying to find a bootcamp that wasn't self-paced, and would fit my work schedule. I spent months looking, stopping and re-starting my search often, but nothing seemed to be quite the right fit. There was one program I looked at several times, and I decided it was out of my price range, and thought I may have to continue forging a path forward on my own. I visited the site for the bootcamp one last time, and I was pleasantly suprised at what greeted me. It was 2020, and the CARES Act had recently been passed and signed into law. The bootcamp had received a round of funding, bringing the price down from tthousands of dollars, to an entry fee a little over 100 dollars. I have since learned that there are (very few) free bootcamps out there, but they have a bit less of a formal setting than the one I attended, so they're not always as obvious.

## My Goals and Aspirations

As I continue on this exciting journey, my ultimate goal is to secure a full-time role as a Web Developer. The path from childhood curiosity to professional aspiration has been winding, but each step has reinforced my passion for this field.
Currently, I'm freelancing on various types of web development projects. This experience has been invaluable, allowing me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, work with diverse clients, and continuously expand my knowledge. Through freelancing, I've had the opportunity to work on custom scripts, full-stack applications, and web design.
I'm excited about the prospect of creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that make the web more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. My freelance work has particularly piqued my interest in [specific area of web development that aligns with your freelance experience, e.g., responsive design, web accessibility, or interactive web applications]. I'm eager to bring these skills and experiences to a full-time role, where I can contribute to larger, long-term projects and collaborate with a team of passionate developers.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on my journey, from dismantling electronics as a child to navigating the complexities of modern web development and now freelancing on diverse projects, I'm reminded of the power of curiosity and persistence. To all aspiring developers out there, remember that everyone starts somewhere. Your path might not be linear, and that's okay. Embrace the challenges, celebrate the small victories, and never stop learning.

For those just starting out, I highly recommend taking advantage of free resources like FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and MDN Web Docs. Join coding communities on platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow – they're invaluable for both learning and networking. And don't underestimate the power of practical experience – whether it's through personal projects, internships, or freelancing, hands-on work is crucial for growth.

Remember, the web development landscape is constantly evolving, so staying curious and adaptable is key. Whether you're customizing your first MySpace profile, building complex web applications, or juggling multiple freelance projects, that spark of creation is what drives us all forward.
As I continue to grow in this field, balancing freelance work with my aspirations for a full-time role, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. Web development isn't just about writing code; it's about problem-solving, creativity, and making the digital world a little bit better, one website at a time.

So, to all my fellow code enthusiasts, whether you're just starting out or well on your way: happy coding, and may your console always be free of errors!
